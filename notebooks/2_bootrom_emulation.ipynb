In the `FlashEfuseReadRow` function there is a write to the `FLASH:EFUSEREAD`, followed by writes to the `FLASH:EFUSEERROR`, `FLASH:EFUSEADDR`, and `FLASH:EFUSE` registers. Afterwards there is a while loop, waiting for the `DONE` bit of the `FLASH:EFUSEERROR` register to be set.\n",

    "  * You can register a simple callback function that creates an execution trace.\n",
